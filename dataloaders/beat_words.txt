The first thing I like to do on weekends is relaxing. And I’ll go shopping if I am not that tired. Since I started my job, I think it’s very important to get a good sleep during your weekend because when you have to work Monday through Friday the whole week, you are very tired. So getting a good rest is as important as completing an excellent job! In my spare time, If I feel OK I will go for a walk or hike in nature. Sometimes I try to organize something for my friends, volunteer at the Buddhist temple on the weekend, or I can just walk around enjoying the sunshine. I’d try to live a healthy lifestyle. Considering how much time I spend sitting at work I always try to move as much as I can while I’m not working. And some other days when I’m free I like to listen to music or watch documentary movies on my laptop but sometimes I just sleep. I especially like watching Japanese anime. I think watching anime is helpful for me to learn and express Japanese better.
So when I have time to kill, I like to play on the Internet and pay close attention to new fashion events. Such as the New York fashion week, the Paris fashion week, the London fashion week, and the Milan fashion week. The rest of the time, I usually go to the library and find some interesting books and then go to a park and relax. There are many books that I find interesting such as fashion magazines, inspirational books, and professional books. These books can give me the motivation to be healthier and energetic.  And the last thing I like to do when I am free is eat out with my family members. You would be surprised to know that I have tried all the restaurants in our huge community. I’ll actually give each restaurant a score based on how good the food is, how good the environment is and at the same time I will write down each type of food they serve. So every time a friend comes to the city to enjoy time with me I will give them the top five best restaurants based on this ranking every time they are very satisfied with these restaurants. Well in my opinion, I think the best job for me is to become a journalist. as this is my dream job. I’ve always wanted to be a journalist since I was in middle school. Journalists never tell lies and are always seeking the truth. I want to be just like that. I usually feel shy when I’m talking to others, and I know that journalists are very good at communicating because good communication skills are very important when you’re doing interviews. I want to possess this skill myself so that’s why I want to become a journalist! Other than that, photography often makes me feel like I am doing a job full of design and innovation. Because for the same scenery, we can use different angles and different compositions. For example people being shifted from the center of the frame to the left side of the frame can make a different feeling, when seen in context with the background. When everyone’s taking a picture of the exact same scenery, I’m very happy when people say my photos look better than others. My favorite kind of movies are romantic films, such as Titanic.  It’s a fantastic film, it captured many young people's hearts with its amazing music and sentimental plots. When I think of the movie Titanic the word that comes to my mind surmises the whole film would be love, it’s the thing that makes the world go round. Watching these kinds of romantic movies it’s just like reading a book that teaches me how to love and be loved. Moreover, we can learn more from it such as things like loyalty and what we treasure in our lives. Another movie about love is Secret. The movie Secret is about a story of a musical prodigy who falls in love with a girl who is dying. There are a lot of enviable moments in this film such as the simple love between high school students. Every time I watch this movie it reminds me of my time when I was in high school and how you might remember the crush you had at school and how you look at him while he’s in class without thinking or wanting to go places with him. The one thing I miss when I’m away from home is my mom. For example, when I’m studying in the university which is 1,400 miles away from my birthplace, the food in my school's cafeteria is awful, and I became 3 kilograms thinner than when I was in high school. So I miss the food my mother cooks for me, especially spaghetti which is a signature dish. I also miss my mom being around. For example I have to organize all my things by myself, prepare the clothes that I should wear in each season, buy medicine all by myself, etc. I also have to think how I should spend my time, because at home my mom always made me go to bed early and when I was in college I usually went to bed late, but sometimes I missed classes because I woke up late the next day. In University, I’ve had to handle these problems all by myself. Even though this improves by independent ability I still miss my mom and her rules. But most importantly I now understand how much my mom has helped me and all her struggles in the process.
Although I live with my parents now I find the things I’m missing the most when I leave the house are simple things. Since my parents lived abroad when I was a child I didn’t live with my parents for a very long time. After 8 years old, I would live abroad with my parents during the winter and summer break. So sometimes it felt like I had almost 2 homes and that made me happy. What am I waiting for at home? I miss my relatives and friends the most. I miss the feeling that I’m at home and everything is familiar. I’ll consider the place I know each home and each street in my neighborhood. I know what I do in my spare time, where to get the best food etc. I also have nostalgia for the memories that I grew up with sometimes with a smile and sometimes I feel anger and the place I grew up with, and it’s important to know that it’s a memory and memories are what keeps me going forward. This memory will make me cherish the time with my family very much now, and keep this happiness in my heart forever. The skill I want to learn the most is cooking. I have good reasons. First, I’m going to study abroad, so cooking is very necessary for me when I start to live alone. As you probably know it’ll be very costly for me to eat out all the time. So cooking is a good way to save money. Usually if you buy the food at the supermarket and cook it for yourself at home you only need to spend about half the money that you would spend at a restaurant. As well you can adjust the amount of seasoning to add when you’re cooking to adjust the taste of the food. For example I like to use very little sugar because I don’t like to eat things that are particularly sweet. And I much prefer using vegetable oil over oils from animals. Secondly if I cook well I would be able to cook for my foreign friends. In this way I could share the culture of cooking from my country. And if I were good at cooking I could do a part-time job to earn a little bit of extra cash. I would like to choose a job that can provide me with a high sense of individual satisfaction.  Firstly, I believe that success is a process rather than a result such as receiving plenty of money. Money and reputation are things that would come as a result of my success. So a high personal sense of satisfaction would let me enjoy the process. Secondly, high personal satisfaction can boost my interest and passion to continue the job. For example I love music, and in my free time I try to remix popular songs, but this kind of thing doesn't make a lot of money. I’d rather have people praise my remixes online than make money. Also through this I can share my own style of music, I like to add a little more drama guitar sounds of the intro of the song as well
 as add a rap in the chorus. Though this is my job, I can share the style of music that I like in my work. In other words, passion and satisfaction are necessary for my career, but money, not so much.
In my opinion, making more money doesn’t always mean you’ll be happier at work. I think that job satisfaction is more important and has more meaning than pursuing a job that has a high salary. I think the reason for happiness and satisfaction is not how much money you make but it’s whether you really want to do the job. I think people can turn a hobby into their own job. If you can’t do it now just keep looking for it. Search until you find a job that is really suitable for you. Then when thinking about the future it’s really important to be happy in your personal life, and that should never be based on the amount of money or quantity of money that you will receive. Because if you are happy and satisfied with your job, then you will be satisfied when you look at other things around you. After all, salary comes once a month, but job satisfaction is your whole career every minute of your day. I would prefer to choose a major that is easy to find a good job in the future like finance or marketing for example. There’s no one that can deny the most common reason for attending university is to get prepared for a good job in the future. So whether the major will lead us to a good job or not is the most important reason why we choose our major. If we find a good job with a decent payment, we can use the money that we have earned from it to satisfy our own interests. For example, I like painting a lot. However I chose painting as my profession. I don't think I can make a lot of money as a painter. But if I go for a major like finance I can get a finance related job after graduation. After university I can get a high salary and in my free time I can use my salary to hire a professional teacher to teach me how to draw. I’ve got a room in my house that is my study room. I have a lot of books in my study room, such as fashion magazines, inspirational books, etc. Also there is a computer in my study room. Usually I will check my computer to learn some study related information such as math problems that I just can’t do. I also am able to use it for fun. For example I am able to catch up on the latest Netflix episodes of my favorite show, and sometimes I’m able to use it to check out some clothes and look inside the latest fashion magazines. However, most of the time I just add them to my cart and don’t  actually buy them. Because I don’t have a job at this time as I was a student I didn’t have much money to buy them. In my spare time I usually like to surf the Internet and pay close attention to the newest fashion news or find some valuable books to recharge the energy inside myself. These books can make me healthier and energetic. My favorite room in my house would be my room. It is the biggest in the house and I adore my room because I am always in my room and never really leave. I get really distracted doing things so I am always there. I do a lot of things there and it’s very nice and beautiful. I have a big closet and it’s packed with so many clothes and bags and just as many shoes. On my desk I put books. And there is a photo of my family on the desk too. In the middle of my room there’s a big soft bed. I have a lovely teddy bear on my bed. When I’m tired I’m able to cuddle up with my teddy bear. On the other side of my room there is a small desk. On it there is my computer. I’ll use it to communicate with my good friends and watch some drama and animations. I put up pictures that I like on my blue wall. I like to keep my toys on the floor. When I’m free I like to play with them. I like being in my room because I can calm down and think better in there. Sometimes I want to stay in my room and not come out. Many of my favorite places in my city have already been destroyed. A few of those favorite places in mind we’re basically a few kilometers from my home. They had no name but these are spots like a small pond with bamboo trees and birds chirping. I always used to bother my father to take me there for its beauty. Presently my favorite place happens to be Hadano Tokawa park. I am in love with the bodies of water in this place and it’s beautiful. We often go up the mountain along long stone steps and I enjoy the scenery along the way. The valley is full of trees and a long drive through it is so much fun. I feel very happy when I’m close to nature. As I feel grateful for the opportunity to be next to nature. I believe nature is amazing and full of magic. When the cherry blossoms are in full bloom we can have a barbecue at the foot of the mountain. However, I like this place when it’s not a weekend as it is already too crowded with people these days. My favorite sport is yoga. I think it’s completely changed the way I look at sports. Yoga is not for competing or being the best, and it’s not about how you look. It’s all about how you feel. Understanding that connection with your own body and discovering the fun in each and every movement is exciting. Every day is different as you discover more and more about your body's abilities and it’s limitations. I find that it grounds me and calms me down some days, and fills me up with energy on other days. Another reason I like yoga is because I usually have a quiet personality in my life so it doesn’t take a lot of time for me to get used to it. Just staying in a quiet place and exercising makes me feel comfortable. It also makes me more aware of my body movements and helps me to get good balance. Additionally, I also like to meditate in yoga, it makes me feel free and relaxes me a lot. If you want to try something new I would highly recommend trying out yoga. I’ll keep doing yoga about three days a week now and it puts me in a good mood every time. Well, I think it’s quite common to see people moving from place to place for different reasons. I also experienced the same thing when I was in the third grade primary school. Actually my parents and I used to live in a village in a joint family house with my grandparents. The experience of being together was so amazing, and the peaceful life from the village away from cities cannot be fully explained in words. However, my family decided to move to Japan because my grandfather was actually Japanese. It was not easy for us to leave our hometown to live in a city where nobody knew us. We found it hard to adapt to a new place and environment. Luckily, our neighbor is really a friendly and kind hearted person. He helped us in every possible way to make us feel comfortable and make the transition to Japan convenient. Although we missed our family and village house a lot, we slowly and steadily used to see life, especially visiting shopping malls, cafés, parks, playgrounds, studying in libraries, and other conveniences of living in a city. I feel that although anyone will feel a little uncomfortable when they go an hour from your place, the variety of change will increase that person’s experience in life. My last trip was when I was about to graduate from my university. At the time, I went to Okinawa alone and it was my first time traveling alone. Since it was my first time traveling alone I had no information about the area and no idea how to read a map. I didn't know my left or my right Iet alone my north and south. I just bought a suitcase and booked a hotel in Okinawa with no plans. I remember that night when I arrived at my hotel I checked my phone to see some of the famous spots in Okinawa. The next day I had breakfast at the hotel and left with my bag on my back. I remember that my first day I went to the famous aquarium but I can’t remember the name of it right now. I touched a beautiful starfish, watched a dolphin show and took many pictures of plants on the seashore. My second day was to go to the famous temple in Okinawa although I have also forgotten it’s name now too. I made a wish for an easy to find job and put my lucky fortune in a tree in the temple. I hope my future goes well and fortune will bring me a good future. No, I really don’t think that people should always tell the truth. Maybe it’s my culture that makes me say that. But where I come from we aren’t super direct. So if someone comes up to you says, “Wow! You are really fat!” no matter who you are you’ll feel hurt. Now if it’s a life or death situation, you have to tell the truth. But when it comes to situations where people’s feelings might be hurt or it really doesn’t matter if it’s the truth or not ,it is better to accept the lie. For example, would you walk into an elementary school and shout, “It’s not true! They are lying to you! Santa Claus isn’t real!” Of course not. However you are lying to children but it’s culturally ok because we are all involved in this lie. If you have kids and it is Christmas time you know this extremely well. But they have to be small things that have no consequence to lie about. But ask any husband what they would say if their wife says, “Do I look fat in this.” They will ten times out of ten tell a lie to make them feel great about themselves. Should people always tell the truth? That’s a difficult question. If you are a police officer or a lawyer I would say yes. As if you are in a position of power it is very important for those people to be honest. If they find themselves in a situation where they could choose to lie or tell the truth it’s incredibly important for them to tell the truth, as if they don’t someone could get hurt or arrested for the wrong information. As a society, we have to know that the truth is one of the most important things. If we lie every day we have to keep up that lie. And keeping up with lies means lying more in order to continue the story that you’ve made up. If someone catches you in a lie you have to lie to get out of it or simply tell the truth. Many people decide to continue the lie as it’s easy until you get caught in a lie. However, we should always tell the truth, as it is important when there are serious issues at hand. It all depends on the context. If you are traveling to see someone who is in a medical emergency or you have a place you need to be in a limited amount of time ,the only way to go is by going straight to the destination. However, if you have time, stop and smell the roses. See the countryside you might find something that you never expected to find. When I travel, I sometimes pick a place to go on a map and wander around that area. Sometimes you find an amazing location and sometimes you find nothing. For example, one time I traveled from Florida to Washington state. It was a 3,000 mile journey, and we ended up in Kentucky and said that something called “Mammoth Caverns” sounds interesting. We weren’t aware that the caverns were the largest series of caverns in the entire country. It was a fantastic find for under twenty dollars. But we tried to do the same trick with the next city we went to ,and ended up in a one room museum that wasn’t worth wandering into. But I guess that is what happens when you go to the biggest twine ball in the world. There are times when you are traveling that you have to stop and take your time to get to places. I find that when I am behind the wheel of a car that I want to get to the destination as fast as humanly possible. When I say as fast as possible if the drive takes twelve hours we are going to take three calculated breaks ,so we can grab a bite to eat and use the restroom. Once we eat or use the faculties it is time to move so we can get to our destination. I like to minimize the amount of time that we are stopped and not moving. Once we get to the destination, we don’t have to worry about getting there and enjoy our time at our destination. Plus if you are on the road long enough you will run into traffic or delays that could stop you from getting to your destination. I also like to drive in the middle of the night. Starting my drive around 9 pm hoping to get to my destination by 6 am or 7 am ,as traffic is very light during the middle of the night. My favorite actor is probably someone you’ve never heard of. His name is Bruce Campbell. If you have heard of him you are probably a horror movie fan. He is a “B” movie superstar. By the way, a B movie means a movie that is usually low budget and is at its core usually a little goofy. Bruce Campbell is a major star in B movies. He was in a small budget horror movie called “The Evil Dead” that made him a horror movie star. He’s played the same character for over forty years from The Evil Dead. His friend and director of “The Evil Dead” is a major director who made the 2000’s “Spider-man” movies. Because he is friends with Bruce Campbell, so sometimes he shows up in small roles in those films. Bruce Campbell is an over the top actor that brings a fun performance to every role he does. If you want to watch one of his movies, I’d highly recommend either “Evil Dead 2” or “Army of Darkness”. Both of those are really fun and not super scary.
If I had to pick my favorite actor I’d probably pick an actor who is not as well known. I would choose an actor named Adam Goldberg. He is fantastic in everything he is in, however he gets cast in really bad roles. He was in a movie called “Déjà vu” which also stars Denzel Washington. It’s a fun action film that no one has seen since 2006. It involves time travel and a crime that can be stopped through the knowledge of the past and the present. Adam Goldberg plays a wacky scientist, much like Christopher Lloyd in “Back to the future”. Without him the movie is a pretty dry by the numbers crime film with a light time travel element. But if you want to see the reason why I think he’s an amazing actor, I would recommend seeing the film “Untitled ''. He’s the lead actor in the film about pretentious artists and it breaks down this strange society, which is actually based on real people, and their minimalist artworks and their general insanity. Adam Goldberg is fantastic in his role in that.I can remember the first time I ate takoyaki or octopus dumplings as we would call them in America. I was pretty new to Japan at the time and I was walking through a major shopping area near Namba station in Osaka. There were a lot of takoyaki stands, and a ton of signs showing how good they were. So I figured, why not give them a shot. Now, if you are not familiar with the food you would probably do exactly what I did. The second I got them I put one in my mouth and realized I had made a mistake ,as it felt like a hot coal was in my mouth. And I was a man with a burning mouth without a drink in my hands. So I did what anyone would do and coughed it out. However after the burning sensation was over I did enjoy them and thought they were super tasty. Back where I am from most people would probably be terrified to eat octopus. I kind of feel bad in retrospect eating octopus as I know how intelligent they are.
There is a food that I think is quite tasty and I am happy I went out of my comfort zone in order to try. One time I was in Tampa, Florida and I was in a particularly seedy area of town, but I was super hungry. There were a couple of shady looking restaurants that looked like I might get food poisoning if I just opened the doors. But there was a Greek restaurant that looked decent enough selling something called a “gyro” ,and I know I was pronouncing it wrong the first time I tried it because I’m not Greek. But after trying it was “love at first bite”. I ate one and ordered another one on the spot ,as it was so tasty! I have to say my mouth is watering just thinking about eating it right now. So if you are ever at a festival or at a mall that happens to have a Greek restaurant, I would highly recommend giving gyros a shot. However, if you are vegetarian I’d recommend avoiding them as you probably won’t enjoy eating the lamb meat inside of it.One movie I would love to recommend to others would be “The Fall” by an Indian director ,that goes by the name Tarsem. I truly believe that this is a masterpiece. It involves a sick patient in a turn of the century hospital ,telling a fantastical story to a young girl. It’s about a hero trying to fight an evil king with his team featuring an explosive expert, a warrior, a bandit, and Charles Darwin. They form together to take down the evil king and save a princess from marrying the evil king. It’s a visually fascinating film that was filmed in over eighty countries. It features shots that are unique to this film. And the story itself is multilayered as the reality of the plot is that it’s about an injured stunt actor explaining his experience in film to a young girl. The film is a love letter to the works of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Charlie Chaplin. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone. It has an impressive visual style, that no other movie has and you get a mini trip around the world while you watch it.
There is a movie called “Time Crimes” that I would highly recommend. It’s a film from Spain but if you’re afraid to watch a movie that is in a completely different language you are in luck, as they barely talk in this movie. I apologize because I am about to spoil this movie and half of the enjoyment is about learning what is happening while the film is going on. A man moves into a new home near woods and finds that there is someone in the woods behind his house. He goes to investigate and finds a masked man stalking him through the woods. He has to outwit the stalker and finds himself jumping into a machine to hide from him. Only to find that it was a time machine. And he finds himself about four hours back in time and finds that he was the masked man that was stalking him. In order to keep the loop going so there are not two of him running around ,at the same time he must reenact the moves he saw himself do as the masked man. Now if that doesn’t make you want to watch the movie there is still a huge chunk of the movie that I didn’t mention about. You should really see it for yourself in order to see how it turns out.Many people have seen the movie “The Matrix” and say there is an interesting film. But if you want to see a movie that is made by the same directors of “The Matrix” I would recommend their overlooked film, “Cloud Atlas”. The film, which stars Tom Hanks, takes characters in different times on the Earth. The story bounces around from the 1800’s, the 1970’s, the present, the near future, and the far future. Every character that you see has a different role in each time period. The film has a plot about past lives and has different characters going through a character arc during those times. The film allows you to explore the sense of humanity through time. It’s quite interesting to see how the characters change throughout the movie ,and you walk away from the film with more questions than answers. Some people like close-ended stories but when you have endings that are open it allows you to think about what you watch and reflect on it. This movie was a flop in the theaters and it is worth your time to watch.
A game that really made me think a lot would be “The Stanley Parable”. In the game, you find yourself as a man named Stanley who is an office worker and realizes that he is the only person in his office. There is a narrator explaining things that Stanley will do ,and as a causal player you can simply follow the voice’s instructions. But if you decide to go against the narrator’s story, the narrator will become flustered and confused as the player seemingly has free will. For example, you find yourself in front of two doors. The narrator says that you will take the door on your left. If you choose the door on your right, you’ll find yourself in a room that is the same as the one you just left. The narrator then says “let’s try this again.” I think the concept of free will that is given to you in what should be a straight forward follow the path game is incredibly interesting. There’s so many paths that you can take in this game that go against the way you are supposed to complete it.The last time I bought flowers was for my significant other's birthday. It was last month. I think it’s important to give flowers at important events ,as it signifies life and prosperity. I think if I didn’t get flowers for her I would probably make her upset. But I really do think that flowers liven up the room that they are in. And it’s nice for the while they are blooming, to look and water them to keep them alive. I think flowers can express many different emotions such as love, sympathy, or a congratulation. I would argue that people that grow and ship out flowers probably make a lot of money during holidays as they are so popular. Maybe I should look into becoming a florist. I think it might be hard to keep my customers satisfied but they need you for important events. Maybe I should go back and look at that profession a little more closely. I think my favorite flower is a sunflower as they are able to give you more than something to look at. Their seeds are very tasty as well!
I can’t remember the last time I gave out flowers. Flowers are really beautiful when they are blooming. However after you put them in the vase and water them, they will only be around for maybe a week or two? What’s the point of something that only lasts a little bit of time? Why waste money on basically ending a plant's life so you can enjoy its flower for a short amount of time. I feel the same way about Christmas trees too. Wouldn’t you say that buying someone something more practical to enhance someone’s life is better than just with a flower? I believe that ,and I try to find things that are useful for the person rather than just seeing something pretty for a little while. Watching a flower wilt away to a brown husk is actually more depressing and will make you remove the flower the second it starts turning brown. That isn’t to say that I don’t like flowers. I like them, I just don’t like things that are a waste to buy. If I had to pick a flower that I like I would pick a rose because roses are multilayered. They have beauty with the petals and pain with its thorns.My favorite festival is in October. Can you guess what it is? It’s Halloween! I think Halloween is a very unique festival as where I am from, there are not many social festivals that don’t involve your core family. You can celebrate Halloween with anyone. I think Halloween is quite interesting ,as you are able to be whomever you’d like to be. You can dress up and become something cute or scary. I think my favorite thing about Halloween is the haunted houses. I’m a big fan of feeling the rush of getting scared. I think haunted houses are a lot of fun. However I completely understand if someone wouldn’t want to go in one ,as they can be really scary. I wish there were more haunted houses that were around more than just during Halloween. I think I would go to one every two months. But if you have kids Halloween is fun because your children get to play pretend that they are their favorite characters ,and they get tons of candy that they can eat throughout the year.
I think my favorite festival is Thanksgiving. During the holiday season you have three back to back celebrations. Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s. Christmas is nice but it requires you to do a lot of work to make other people happy. Also Christmas is extremely stressful as you have to fight in stores to get the presents that people want. It can also be extremely expensive. New Years is fun but it gets crazy and I’m not a night owl so I’d rather be done with celebrating by 10 pm. Thanksgiving is great, because it’s just a day where you can eat and enjoy time with your family and friends. I really like to cook a nice tasty turkey for everyone to enjoy. I think we can all enjoy a good meal together, watch a movie ,or show as a family and then see each other again on Christmas. It’s a simple experience that families can have together. Sometimes however people get pretty tense with upsetting topics at the dinner table however it is usually only a few hours long compared to an entire day.One application that I use a lot on my phone is called iMovie. This app is pretty useful for expressing yourself. You can find this app in the app store on phones using an Apple IOS. I’m not sure how much it costs now, however when I got it, it was free. However, that was roughly 8 years ago. With iMovie you can edit your video clips together in order for you to tell a story or visually express yourself ,to show how you feel or show people how things work. My favorite thing to do with iMovie is to make videos that show people things that they may not see. Whenever I go on vacation, I’m constantly filming. I love showing the world and the story about that interesting thing that I want to show ,and helping people to learn about it. However iMovie does crash a lot. Sometimes you can finish a project to find that everything that you’ve done has disappeared. There is really no way to save your work on the phone as there is no interface to do that.
One app I’m not proud to say that I use a lot is the facebook app. It connects you with your friends and family. But it really sucks you in and kind of makes you become a zombie ,as you walk around looking down at your phone for hours at a time. I don’t know if others feel this way, but I think the connection to the digital world distracts from the real world. Is that the future? Is that what we will strive to do? Leave likes and comment “cute” on photos. Constantly scrolling up and down on the app waiting for new images and posts to come in so we can watch in silence. This is a problem that is quite a dilemma. There will be younger people that will be raised by apps like facebook. They might have a need to be liked ,and it might be a different human experience that hasn’t been experienced on this planet before.A long time ago, I moved to Japan from America. I was told that I would experience a lot of culture shock. Other than the language, which even now I’m still having trouble getting the hang of, I’ve never really found myself with much of an issue. However, I would never under any circumstances recommend someone to move to Japan during August. As it is so hot, I’m pretty sure that you could cook an egg on the street in seconds. Having to lug around a couple suitcases full of your stuff is pretty rough. Not to mention you have to bring them up hills and inclines in really hot weather. If I could have, I wish I would have moved to Japan in fall or spring as it is much cooler. However, I believe that if I came during those times I wouldn’t realize how hot it truly is in the summer months. It made me learn that I should probably prepare for brutally hot summers in Japan.
When I started my university studies I found myself in one of the biggest campuses in the nation. Not knowing what to do or where to go when classes started was a big worry to me. So I took it upon myself to walk around the entire campus, twice. I want to mention that my school was over two miles long. I spent the whole day wandering around the buildings, including the ones I knew I’d be spending a lot of time in. It was quite an adventure. I learned about the clubs I could join and extracurricular activities that I could be a part of. This allowed me to be pretty knowledgeable about the things I could do on campus. Some of my roommates were foreign exchange students that I met later in my university life so I was able to show them around easily.When I was in university there was only one correct answer to tell you my favorite restaurant. That answer is Lazy Moon. It is one of the best pizza places on the planet. Let me get into reasons why this place is the best. First, it’s cheap. You can get a slice of pizza the size of your chest ,and a cold beer for under five dollars. Second, oh man the pizza is good! You’d think for five bucks you’d get a doughy pizza ,but it is always a perfect slice of pizza pie. Since I left the city, the single restaurant has expanded into a chain in the city it is in. This is what they call a win. Not only can I get amazing pizza, I can get pizza in multiple places throughout the city. I can tell you that I spent at least forty dollars a month at this restaurant ,and if I still lived in the city I went to university in I’d probably still be doing the same.
My favorite place in the city that I live in is probably Tokyo Disneysea. I know what you are saying, ”Your favorite place in the world is a theme park? Are you a little old for that kind of thing?” Well, I think that this is one of the most interesting places in the world. It’s the most unique and impressive theme park built by Disney. The rides are incredible and it might be the best theme park in the world. The only thing I don’t like about the park is how busy it can be. It’s so packed to the brim with people. And it’s amazing because it’s so huge! I don’t know how many people have the day off at the same time to actually go to places like this. Then again I guess because Disney is a household name it makes people want to go here rather than a smaller local theme park. If there was a way to bring the prices down on the food a little bit too that would make the experience there better too. But I don’t think there is a chance that they would ever do that.So there are parents that will allow their children to spend their money as they like ,and there are some that tightly control their money. Recently an adult musician named Brittney Spears was just released from her father’s power over her money as a musician. So ,sometimes that goes beyond childhood into adulthood. But I think it’s better to take a little bit from both to allow children to know that they can spend money ,but at the same time have to understand that you can’t just buy everything that you want. If you don’t let children use the money that they’ve earned they might become upset and ask why did they earn the money anyway? If you allow them time to purchase things that they find important to them, they will be happy. But you can’t let children just spend their money on everything or they will see money like monopoly money. So you have to educate your children how to use ,and when to use their money intelligently.
I think it is incredibly important to control your children’s money. The reason I say this is because, have you ever seen what children buy? They have no concept of the value of the dollar so they will use their money for silly things. Toys that will break in moments, sugary candy, and things that they will forget moments after they purchase them. They may be earning money ,but you have to teach them that you can’t just toss that money down the toilet. If you control their money you will be able to teach them how to save and possibly the concept of investment, if you could explain why they would enjoy investing their money that in the future could get them more of what they want. I think this ability to buy anything they want but not be able to purchase them without parental permission ,would allow them to grow as a consumer. Not to be forced by commercials that say “you must buy this!” I think too much is forced upon young buyers. This allows them to look logically at their decisions.I would much rather take a very long vacation rather than multiple short ones. As when you are on a long vacation you can enjoy everything you can stop and smell the roses as they say. When I was in Vietnam I met a man who was a professional chef. He told me that he worked only about six months of the year. The rest of the time he spends in third world countries and uses his large salary to survive cheaply in these countries. If I could afford to work half the year and live a fun exciting life in a very cheap country I would be happy to work every single day for six months if I knew that all that hard work would pay off. As of right now it just seems like I work every day with very little pay off.
Realistically, how can one take very long vacations? You have to take time off of work in order to get free time. I can’t think of many companies that enjoy letting their employees off for two weeks at a time to travel for fun. I think it’s much more important to take small short vacations. Enjoy those special holiday weekends where you get three or four days off and go someplace to enjoy and relax and then come back. I think going to places for a long time is a waste because after two or three days of being there you’ve mostly seen everything already. Short vacations are great because it gives you just enough to explore, have fun and leave more to come to in the future!When a person lies to me I can promise you I will be upset if I learn about it. When a person lies to you it means that they don’t respect you nor do they respect your character. If I learned that someone is spreading rumors about me I would first be angry and wouldn’t speak to that person ever again. If one of their lies got to me, I would argue who did you hear that from, because the person who originated that lie is this person. I would talk about how that person is known for jumping to conclusions ,and not focusing on facts but rather what they feel at the time. I would bring their character into the conversation and ask if they have heard anything else from that person that was wild. Some people have an ax to grind and you sometimes are that person they want to grind.
If someone lied to me and I found out about it, the first thing I would do is ask the person why they are spreading these rumors. They may only be rumors and untrue; they may not be in the court of popular opinion. If someone believes that lie then it could jeopardize your entire career and future. I would warn the person that if they continue this path it might showcase their own hubris. If they decide they want to spread lies if they do something wrong or incorrect they might be the next player in the game of court of public opinion. This might actually make him or her rethink what they are saying as since they’ve already slighted someone they might be ready to strike when they least expect it to help ruin their reputation. I would hope that this would allow the person to realize that they are doing the wrong thing in order to correct their actions.In my spare time I really enjoy listening to songs, going to museums and watching TV. I‘d like to have music on while I am cooking or having dinner because music can make me relax. I’ll have a very enjoyable time while listening to songs. I also like to go to museums because there are so many different and unique museums in Japan. Have you ever heard about Unko Museum? It is a poop museum and everything is about poop! It is really unique and Japanese people made it a very cute and interesting museum. I believe you will have a fun time there! I like watching a lot of TV shows too.
In my spare time I really like to watch movies. I think over the past few years because of the situation that has caused us to stay home for a while, I’ve tried my hardest to avoid crowds and people. One of the best things you can do and kind of think about how things used to be ,before we had this change is watch movies. I love a good film that makes you think about it after the movie is over. If I could, I wish I could make a movie. But the idea of making a film hurts my head. I think I have a story to tell but I don’t have the budget, cast, and talent to edit an entire film. If I had that I would be making short films every weekend and uploading them to youtube. Other than watching movies and daydreaming about being a director I also like to play video games. However I know I have to get out more often as staying home all the time is going to be terrible for my midsection. So maybe I should start exercising more.I’d like to be a professor. There are many reasons I choose to be a professor. Firstly, I want to teach because I like the pace of the academic calendar. Two long vacations offer me an opportunity for reflection, research and writing. Secondly, I want to teach because I like the freedom to make my own mistakes, to learn my own lesson, to stimulate myself and my students. And I can have the opportunity to keep on learning. Finally, I want to teach because, being around the students who are beginning to grow and change in front of me, I will grow and change with them too. But teaching is no easy job at all. I must study cleverly to obtain more knowledge. And, at the same time, I will make every effort to purify my soul so that I can become an architect of man's soul.
If I could go back in time and choose a job I think I would reconsider my current career in order to become a marine biologist. I think it would be amazing to be able to work with animals and study sea life. I think the seas are the most important thing on our planet right now. They span over 75 percent of the planet. Whatever happens to seas will cause troubles on land. I think if I could be a marine biologist I would try to study the effects of global warming. I believe that the seas are important and I wish I could be more involved in its protection, and the protection of the animals that live inside of it. Also I would like to be involved in the education of the general public in order to help them to understand how to protect the seas.My favorite kind of movie is comedies. I have some reasons why I like comedies most. First, comedies are very interesting and the story makes me happy and laugh. I believe everyone goes through sad times. When I am sad, I like to watch a comedy, because it will help me to forget my sadness and I focus on the happiness that comedy brings. Also, even though I am not sad, when I am spending time with my friends, I’d like to watch comedy too because when we are watching together, we will laugh together! It is such a wonderful time!
If I had to pick one genre I would pick horror. Horror films can be surreal, scary, treats or low-budget trash. I really enjoy both of those. If I could give an example of two different movies that I would recommend in this genre, I would say “Hellraiser” as an example of a great horror film, and “Manos: The hands of Fate '' as shock garbage that is still fun to watch. Clive Barker’s Hellraiser is such a fun trip through a world of people who are seeking to find the limits of experience. It has a lot of symbolism and is quite a scary experience to watch alone. On the other hand, Manos: the hands of fate was made because a person who sold animal manure made a bet with a producer that he could make a movie for $5000. And it looks like it was shot and made for about 30 dollars. It’s so bad it’s a masterpiece. I don’t know how you mess up filmmaking that bad.I miss my parents and my best friends a lot when I am away from home. My mom always cooks for me and my dad always takes me out. When I am away from them for a long time, I miss the time I spent together. I miss the food my mother cooks for me. I am not a very good cook, so I can’t cook as delicious as my mom. Even though sometimes I go to restaurants to eat, the taste is still different from my mom’s. So I miss a lot of family food when I am away from home. Also, I miss my friends, we used to have a lot of fun going out and playing games. I miss the time we spent together, and hopefully I will be able to see them soon!
 Listen, people are nice, food is great back home, however the one thing I miss the most when I leave home is, my mom’s dog. The dog is getting older but I still have fond memories with it. I think I like just having something that likes me and I can help take care of it. Every time I come back home that dog is just as excited to see me as it was the last time I saw it. It’s such a cute little dog. I wish I could have a dog where I live but the building that I live in just wouldn’t allow me to have a pet. So when I go back home I feel so happy because I know I have a friend waiting for me that just wants to say hi when I walk into the door.I would like to learn drawing the most. It is related to a lot of things in our daily life. It can help to improve the sense of beauty. When we design clothes or architecture, everything is based on drawing. I think drawing is the best of almost any form of art, drawing allows one to express feelings and emotions that words can’t describe. When we want to concentrate on something, drawing will be a pretty good skill that I can make my own idea into a drawing.
I think most people would answer this by learning a fun skill that you could use in a hobby. If I could learn a skill I would rather learn something more helpful. I believe I would like to take a course in how to successfully perform first aid, CPR, and use of the AED machine. About twenty years ago I took a class, however first aid and CPR training has changed so much in the time that I have learned it as every second is important during these times. I think it would be valuable for me to be certified in first aid because I would be able to help people in my community, my office,when it is needed. I just hope no one tries to sue me for trying to help.Well, it is a really difficult question. In my opinion, making more money doesn’t always mean you’ll be happier at work. If the job I choose has an OK salary and at the same time, if it can get personal satisfaction, that will be great. However, if it has a very low salary, I believe it will be very hard for anyone. But I might choose to work a second job to support my job that can get personal satisfaction because I don’t want to give up the job that can get satisfaction.
Money makes the world go around. Money is important. Without money you can’t live. But can you live with what you do if you hate it and just make a lot of money? I truly believe the answer to that is no. It’s important to get paid but if you hate your job and you just look at your paycheck and hate your job your performance in that job will be low and others will see how much effort you actually put into your work. I think it’s much more rewarding to be in a job that will allow you to be happy and make you believe that every time you walk into work you are happy rather than just going in for a paycheck.My favorite room in my house would be my room. It is the biggest in the house and I adore my room. I do a lot of things and it's very nice and beautiful. My room is awesome. I love how I have it all decorated. I have hanging hearts in the ceiling. Also,I love my room and I have magazines a lot actually, and bags hanging all over as much as shoes all over the place. I have a big closet and it's packed with so many clothes and purses as much as shoes. I have scarves hanging in this colorful lamp and I have a flat screen tv hanging on my wall ,and I love to watch movies and put on music. Also I have three big speakers because I have a lot of CDs and tapes though they are pretty outdated now.
My favorite room in my house is my living room. My living room is the most fun room in the house. There is a big tv in there that everyone uses. We have a playstation that has over thirty different kinds of party games that my family and friends play when they come over. We have a variety of board games that we can play. Many nights in the house ended playing board games together. I have a lot of good memories there, even though it is just a room I can think about all the good times I have had in there. It’s almost like a member of my family.My favorite sport is running because it is a very easy and free sport that everyone can try. I started it about five months ago. I try to keep as healthy as possible. And as I mentioned before it is a very cheap and easy sport ,and all we need is a pair of running shoes and a bottle of water. I made some new friends while I was running in the park. They are quite nice and friendly people. Sometimes we encourage each other to keep on and don’t give up. Every time right after I feel my body is great. And after a few months of running I can run for longer hours without feeling tired. I’m pretty happy about this free sport and I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to be healthy.
My favorite sport activity is swimming and I must say I love this sport very much but living in a city you’d think it would be easy to continue to practice this sport, however I find it’s quite hard as you have to time out when you want to go to a busy pool. I hate being surrounded by people. And thinking about all the chemicals in the water at the pool makes me miss living in a warm tropical climate ,where I could go swimming almost every day of the year with the exception of two or three months, as it’s a little too cold. If I could be at the beach every day I would be in the water doing distance swimming. I truly wish I could still do that but when you live in a place with seasons it is just too cold to go into the water.My last trip was to go to south east Asia, I went to Cambodia and Vietnam. Cambodia is a very very historic country. I really enjoyed Siem Reap. We went to the famous attraction Angkor Wat. We spent the whole day there because it is so huge. Even two days will not be enough to visit the whole Angkor Wat ,and not to mention it's so hot there. Then we went to Vietnam ,and the fruit in Vietnam is so delicious that I would love to go back someday in the future. It is so cheap to live in Vietnam. The lifestyle in Vietnam is quite different from Japan,   on the road. There are so many people riding their bicycles it is very interesting to see it. My friends told me that there are so many people riding bikes or scooters on the roads ,that if you drive a car you will take very, very long as they are not able to move as well as the scooters.
So traveling during covid has been a nightmare! I had to return to America for a family medical emergency and it was so hectic to get the PCR checks within 72 hours ,and try to find the cheapest one in order to enter and exit different countries. This is an extra expense that should be provided by the airlines, as it would help protect the crew. Regardless, in America it’s like the pandemic isn’t even a thing. Most people are wearing masks mostly under their noses. Once you leave the airport you are free to basically do whatever you like. Coming back to Japan it is almost like being in a Kafka story. You have to go to multiple places, wait in certain areas in those places, then go to a hotel for six days. At least you are fed for six full days. I just pretended it was part of the vacation. But I wish it was easier but I’m happy we were all healthy and safe. But it is amazing to see the differences in how different countries deal with the current set of events in the world.Well the skill I could probably teach anyone is the basics of the English language. I have over seven years of experience teaching and I have learned that no two students are the same. It’s really important when you are learning English to first have a positive first lesson. Always try your best to make the first lesson simple if you can do that the students will see that they are able to achieve it. You can steadily start leveling them up until they can get to simple sentences. From there the sky's the limit. Most people want to learn how to speak conversational English. That does take a while but if you can get the basics of the language you’ll be well on your way. I think I could teach these skills to people with ease ,which would allow them to communicate with more people from around the world.
I believe one skill I could teach others is about film editing. I would first break down some common lingo in the field. I would mention how to edit and maybe a little bit of the history of editing, as it is super easy to do now compared to ten years ago. Then I would actually show someone how to edit. I think the key is all about timing. You could be amazing at placing your edits but the most important thing is when and where you cut in order to masterfully and seamlessly make the action movie in your story. Editing is something that takes time to get just right but when you get it you feel like your storytelling skills have increased tenfold. Editing is really rewarding because you create the final product that people actually get to view and see. I’d highly recommend trying to edit something of your own as it is quite fun! Give it a shot sometime!The best time of the year for me is when I get to volunteer at the Buddhist temple. It includes leading the way for serving as a guide for people who come to the Buddhist temple. Last week I also went to the Buddhist temple and was assigned to the job of standing in front of the elevator to be a guide. When people passed by, I would greet them with a smile and a bow. I remember a very old man who didn’t know where the place of worship was. I helped him and walked with him to that place. He happily chatted with me and said that it was his first time to come into the Buddhist temple in Yokohama. He told me it was because he lives in Chigasaki, where he only goes to temples in Shonan. I am very happy to help others through the Buddhist temple and I have received many unexpected surprises. To me, the best time of the year falls after winter vacations. During this period of time there is a lot of work to do because of our entire course, and then we sit in our homes studying. But still, I like this time because we are free from school and waking up early in the morning. And then the week begins to break down. The last day of school is the most memorable day of school in the whole of the year. Then the day arrives that every student fancies…. THE SUMMER BREAK!!! And that is why we get to sleep more. All of the students enjoy themselves with their families and best friends. People visit different places in their own beloved country. Student’s hang out at different eating places; where they eat less and laugh a lot. Girls talk about different fashion icons, and brands-gossip is their most akin topic. Boys like to talk about sports and superb cars. The best time of the year is Valentine’s Day. Because I got a present from my family and I was pretty happy about it. It was the bag that I wanted to have. Last time when I went to the store I thought I was a little hesitant to buy it or not. And I didn’t buy it because I was not sure if I needed it or not. However when I got back home on Valentine's Day I was super super happy because I was thinking about it and it was in my home! It is a very good bag that allows me to carry my computer and all the other necessary staff for work. It is designed well too! It was such a surprise and I am really happy I got it as a Valentine's present as a surprise!
The best time of the year hands down is Halloween. I know you might think that’s for kids. Nah, Halloween is for everyone. Halloween is an interesting time of the year. Most people associate Halloween with candy and treats. But I associate it with parties and haunted houses. Two things that I am a huge fan of. I actually started planning for Halloween in August because I want to have a good costume and plan where I want to go to see scary things. One time, I traveled to Singapore in order to see the haunted houses even though they were there for three days. I loved it and I wish I could go every year but it’s a bit too expensive. If I could I would run my own haunted house. I know it would be a challenging business to run but I think it would be fun and profitable to run.I remember in 2015 I was in a rut. I was working a dead end job and unsure what to do next. I found myself at a crossroads. I wasn’t sure what the right answer was. Then I saw an opportunity to move to Japan. On a whim, I decided to apply. I never thought I would get a call back. I forgot about it. Three months later I was sitting on my couch still trying to figure out what I should do in future. My phone rang and a person on the other end wanted to talk to me about heading to Japan. I couldn’t believe that I was actually getting this chance. I decided to continue further and within three months I was living a new life in Japan. I never thought I’d live outside of the USA by myself but I made my goal a reality and I’m now living a life that I am happy to be living doing jobs I am happy and excited to do.
For years I had always wanted to be an actor. I’d tried my best to land gigs but they usually didn’t pay or didn’t match up with my schedule. I moved to Orlando, Florida for university and was pretty excited because I saw a chance to become a scareactor in one of Universal Studios seasonal haunted houses. I thought it would be a fun chance to try something different and be a part of a theme park and try something exciting. And it was so much fun I got to see how all the things work behind the scenes at these events, I scared a ton of guests, and was even able to meet people that shared my interests that I continue to be friends with more than a decade later. If I had a time machine I know where I would go back to in October of 2009. It was so much fun and so exciting! I have had a lot of birthday parties but I think my favorite was when I was twenty five my Mom got me an amazing gift: two tickets to see “The Eagles”. They may be a dated band but I dare you tell me that “Hotel California” is not one the best songs ever made. I was so excited to go to the concert as I had heard their music for years and it was an incredibly fun time as it was all outdoors. The concert itself wasn’t too crazy as most of the fans of the band are in their 60’s. Their encore was Hotel California. They brought down the house and it was one the best birthdays I've ever had.
It was my birthday and I was turning thirteen. I remember being in school and I was called to the front office. It was like about twelve o’clock. When I came to the front my mom said we were heading out and I could leave school early. She told me when we got in the car that we were heading to Disney World. I was so excited! When I got to the hotel my mom said “Ok you go enjoy the park.” So I wandered around Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Magic Kingdom by myself. I had so much fun! It was so exciting to be allowed to do everything I wanted by myself! It was awesome! When I came back to the hotel my mom told me she just enjoyed the pool. I had so much fun I’m glad that they did too. We went to the parks together on the next day and did everything my parents wanted to do. It was an amazing birthday!Well, emotion is one of the basic things that make us human. And anger is one of them. I normally get angry when a speedy rash driving vehicle crosses me on-road or someone with a high pitch modified exhaust system. They do it just for fun, not considering how they affect others. For a few seconds, I am really tempered, and would like to say: ‘it’s so terrible! I’m so damn sick of these cars! Nobody can tolerate them! Nobody drives like this, you should really listen to yourselves to hear how loud your car is!' I think getting angry is human nature and hard to control. For me, another example is when someone tells rumors about me, or backstabbing me will actually make me angry. I think the thing that makes me angry is when someone is repeatedly late and always not on time. Being repeatedly late is a sign of disrespect. It’s easy to make people feel angry and I think most people understand that being late is a sign of not respecting another person‘s time. It’s OK to get angry at people who are always late. And sometimes I know that I can’t change other people's behaviors, but what I can change is how I react to it. Sometimes you need to have a discussion with people saying, “If you're always going to be late, I don’t want to make plans with you anymore.” This sets a clear boundary and states that you need to be treated fairly. A good friend will understand and try to change. A selfish friend will agree and still be late anyway. However a codependent friend will attack you with unreasonable demands.The most angry event in my childhood is that my dad planned to take me to Disneyland to have a fun time with him, however on the day before he told me that because of the overtime work he cannot go with me. He promised to me many many times that he will take me for my birthday celebration, however it didn’t come true. I was pretty upset. And what makes me angry about it is because this is not the only one time something happened. 
The angriest I’ve ever been was when one of the school bullies decided to pick on me. I was upset at him and I decided that I was going to fight him. But since I didn’t have friends with me. His friends pretty much beat me up, ran over my hands with their bikes, and strangled me. It wasn’t a fun time. That was the last school yard scrap I was ever in because it didn’t solve anything. The bully was still a mean person and harassed many people in school. The funniest thing about this, was that later in life the bully’s brother started an anti-bully program. I hope his brother decided to go through it. He was so mean and also extremely hurtful to people from other cultures. I never wish to see that man again.One time I was at a public park and saw some young kids smoking cigarettes and generally being delinquents. My first thought was how the heck these kids were getting their cigarettes. Like who in their right mind would say, well I was a kid once and I smoke now I better be a good person and buy these kids cigarettes. I think this is a reason why in a society we have rules. Some rules don’t make sense to follow but we follow them anyway. But if you don’t make rules, like don’t give kids tobacco and clearly show why we shouldn’t do such things ,and have an appropriate punishment for why you shouldn’t do it ,people will still do it because they don’t have common sense.
I don’t know how people raise children. It’s not my place to tell others how or how not to raise a kid. But your child openly picks on a child that is weaker or has physical or mental disabilities. I will probably think less of you and your offspring. Case and point I was walking in the mall and there were a group of kids harassing this obviously challenged individual. Why were they doing it? Because they could. If I was their teacher I’d put them in detention for the rest of their primary school days, and wouldn’t let them out until they understood that they were tormenting a human that has emotions and feelings. But alas I’m not their teacher. I don’t find it nice to treat people awful and these kids deserve to learn a lesson in how to treat others.When I first started living on my own I didn’t have a job that provided a high salary. To make ends meet I would do overtime work and I was at the same time studying for my certification exam. However in the room above there was a family and I swear that every single night they had a party. It was like they were constantly playing with bowling balls down the middle of either room. Every night there was a fight. Every night something smashed on the ground. About a week before my certification exam I couldn’t stand it anymore and decided that I was going to do something about it. So I went up to the door and politely complained to them about the issue. They just kind of “uh-huh’d” me and shut the door in my face. I promised myself “as soon as I get enough money I’m getting the heck out of this place and someone else can deal with these people.”
One time I had to set up the internet on property that was owned by my parents. This should have been an easy twenty minute process. All I had to do was call the company and say turn on the internet and then the process would be done. My father neglected to tell me there is a username that I need. Where was the id? At my dad’s house three hours away. So after working a 15 hour shift I had to drive 3 hours back to my dad’s house in order to call the company. But the username was hidden in the house. Oh and he also had stock in the company that he was using so there were user numbers that didn’t actually do anything. After searching for hours being up for about thirty six hours I found the correct username. I went to lay down to sleep. Guess what, it was time for the above apartment to retile their floor. BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG. There was no chance I would get any sleep after that.Today I went to collect rent from our apartment. Usually, they come to our house to pay bills but they had delayed more than two months. Someone has not paid her electric bills for the last two months so I asked her about it. She said that her son's exams were going on and that's why she needs money to spend on him. She and her husband are working hard to keep the roof above their head. I was impressed. So I told her not to worry about bills. And asked her if she needs any other help. She said she was worried about her son. Poor guy was very stressed. He was working really hard to get into a reputed engineering college. She was really depressed because last year, due to bad rank her elder son couldn't make it into a good college and they did not have much money to support him. Reservation killed her dreams and all hope for a bright future.The last time I got lost in another city was in 2017. I went to Singapore with two of my friends for our summer vacation. Singapore has a very complex road network. And someone without a sense of direction like us will easily get lost even if you’re using a map or following the instructions of the GPS. Besides, Singapore is a historic city with a large number of tourist attractions. Some attractions are quite near each other, so we didn’t have to take the bus, we just walked to the next attraction. We regretted the decision not to take the bus since we couldn’t find the right way. On our way to the next attraction we chatted with each other for a long time and the worst thing was that the signal on our cellphones were not very good and we could not connect to the map. We were so worried and did not know what to do. There were hardly any people on a quiet street. We had to keep on walking and I hope that we could meet someone new. When I just came to Japan I was pretty new to the city. So one day I had to go to work but when I got out of the train, I didn’t know where I should go because my phone did not have wifi. So I asked a lady however she couldn’t understand my English. I tried my hardest and eventually she understood where I wanted to go. There she took out her notebook, drew me a map of how to go there and explained three times. Without her help I would have not been able to get to the right place. I’m happy she decided to help me and give me advice on where to go. It was a really nice impression of Japan and its people.
One time I was in Vietnam and my friend went missing. I had cell phones and GPS but I had to find someone in the capital city of Vietnam without contacting them. I wandered around the area I last saw them but we couldn’t find one another. I wandered around the big city, went back to the hotel that we were staying at and back to where I last saw them. I walked about 20 kilometers. In this city there is a train that goes through a market and when I was looking for my friend I almost got hit by that iconic train. I thankfully found them two hours later. For the next three days I couldn’t walk right because I was really trying to find them.I just want you to know I’m going to talk about the passing of a dog. Some people get really depressed by the passing of animals. When I was five years old I met my best friend. I had a little black dog named Shakespeare, I know a weird name for a dog but it was one of my best friends. When I was eighteen my dog was still with me. I loved that little dog. Then the dog started to have mini strokes and had a hard time seeing. I remember one day she was shaking on the floor, bobbing her head back and forth on the floor violently. Everyone in the house knew it was the time to say goodbye to our friend. I wish that life could go on forever but if the quality of life is very poor it’s not fair to the animal. We had to put that little black dog down. She crossed the rainbow bridge and anytime I think about it I tear up. I didn’t have a lot of friends when I was a young child but Shakespeare was always with me and it still hurts that I can’t see that dog again.
One of the saddest days of my life was when my grandfather passed. It was a sad day. I remember it was about four in the morning when I got the news. At the time, I lived with three roommates. They were still partying from the night before and I was just so confused after just waking up from this horrible news. I was in tears. I was unable to process things and my roommates were pretty loopy and they tried to consult me but I was inconsolable. I remember just running out of the house and going for an hour-long walk in the cold, foggy night. I cried so much I collapsed on the ground in tears. Thankfully no one was around to see me in my awful state. The passing of someone can really affect you and it’s something you can never get back. It’s important to spend time with the people you love as one day they just will not be there anymore. One of the saddest days of my life was when my grandfather passed. It was a sad day.

People are free to do everything on the Internet. They can say or do whatever they feel there. However, the Internet also allows for people to have a platform to harass people. They are able to give bad or rude comments to other people. This is also the case for celebrities, who are being attacked by Internet commenters all the time. A famous female star from Korea committed suicide because of this harassment. The government took some actions to control the networks and users must be registered with their real names. It worked and this form of harassment has been controlled in some way. We need to behave ourselves even without the supervision of law. I hope you all protect yourselves. And when you send messages to people, be careful about what you write and post online. I don’t share an unkind personal comment or image. Remember that just because you have a computer in front of you, it doesn’t mean that the person on the other side is not a real human being. I look down on people who cry in public a lot. When someone gets a bad grade on a test and starts to sob, it pisses me off. It seems very manipulative because it's almost pressuring the people around you to comfort you when nothing that bad actually happened. To me, it's the same as when someone says "I'm sooooo ugly/dumb/etc." and then waits for the people around them to go "nooo, you're the smartest, prettiest, coolest person I've ever met." It's like they're turning the people around them into their safety blanket. Also I look down on people when they constantly blame others for the bad things happening to them but don't bother to think of solutions. I have a friend who keeps complaining about how he owes $700 to his phone provider, $1500 in credit card debt, etc, but all he does is spend his money on cigarettes, liquor and other drugs. I suggest paying everything off little by little and putting some money aside to build a savings, but he ignores it and the debt just keeps piling up. One person I think is incredibly selfish is someone I believe is a clown. I really don’t want to say who he is as I have no interest in saying his name. However he was in a place of power in the USA. I believe he is a terrible role model for the younger children and young adults in America. The lessons he taught were how to lie, steal, and take advantage of your situation. I don’t think that’s the way we should behave. I think that a leader should be someone who represents the entire country without cutting down others based on personal beliefs. I don’t trust politicians though when you vote for them they promise the world and when they are in office they give you nothing. I think this person has done this to the country that I am from and I don’t like the way the country is because of it. We are super divided and this person and his selfishness caused this rift. Now I ask you, the person who is listening to me speak. Am I speaking about Biden or Trump?
A person I think who is incredibly selfish is one of my friends who doesn’t seem to understand that even though we are friends ,you can’t just walk all over me to get your way. Being friends is a two way street. You come together to make decisions that allow you to be friends. But if that friend only allows one way , it’s time to talk with them. I hate it when you can’t express yourself to friends that treat you poorly and act like it’s your fault when they go out of their way to borrow money from you without paying you back, borrowing your things and never giving them back, or just wasting your time when you have limited time to enjoy outside of your working time. I have decided that I will not be friends with this person anymore. I think I will tell them why I don’t want to be friends with them and then disappear. But is that the right thing to do? Nope. I’ve got to be a good person and try my hardest to at least give them a chance to change their ways. I hope my friend does that or they won’t be my friend for very long. When I see someone being bullied I find it hard to sit back and do nothing. But if you involve yourself then you are a part of the mess and you become a target. I think the best thing to do if someone is being professionally bullied like in the office or in the workplace is to make sure you tell upper management that something is wrong and give examples of what has happened. I must admit, I hate seeing bad things happening to people. It’s not fair when someone picks or bullies someone because they are bigger or stronger. However it’s quite hard to actually stop bullying. In schools that have a bullying problem they will put up posters saying “Don’t bully people.” Realistically that does nothing and it is a bigger problem that should be looked at seriously.
If I see someone getting bullied I find it's best to turn around and walk the other way. I can’t stand to see people picked on but I don’t want to be a part of whatever is happening between those people. It angers me that I have no power to stop these people. However if I help I believe the bullies will then start picking on me as “misery loves company”. It’s a sad fact of life that life is just not fair. If you look at different places and companies it is not the smart that always rise to the top, it’s the more cunning and those who can read people better. I wish it was easier and the good person should always win but it’s just not how it works and it is truly sad. I want to preface that the statement I’m supposed to make here is, experiences of being friendly to people that you hate. I want to point out that hate is quite a strong word and it is hard to say that I actually hate someone. If I really don’t like someone I do my best to avoid them. However if I had to work or speak with someone that I really didn’t want to be around I would act professional and put a smile on my face. However, it is quite hard to keep up that farce for more than three hours. Sometimes you have to just walk away in order not to get upset when they do something that you don’t like. When I worked with someone I couldn’t avoid I would mostly smile and pretend like everything was fine. I would ask if I could be excused to get fresh air for a few moments to get away when I could. But sometimes you just have to grin and bear it.
If you really hate someone and you have to be friendly you have to think how you are supposed to act in normal settings. You have to pretend that they really are your friend. If you don’t you will start to pull out your hair trying your best to rack your brain of how to get out of the situation with that person. You must pretend that from the moment that you must have conversations and must do tasks with this person. You have to imagine that this person is one of your best friends and act like you would in a professional manner. If you don’t you will see the faults of this person, the anger will build up inside you and you might explode on them. Which is something you can’t do as a coworker. As you might get fired if you do that! Well the world is so small. Actually, last year, I was visiting a client during my work time. On the way back, I ran into a college classmate who was walking on the street. We were both very surprised to see one another, ‘wow, Why are you here too? Long time no see!’ ‘It's been three or four years since we've seen each other, right?’ We are very happy to meet together after not seeing each other for such a long time. We gave each other a warm hug and decided to spend some time together. We went to a cafe to sit. While we were eating and drinking, He told me that he is now working at a middle school as an English teacher. ‘Oh, you found your dream job! I remember you wanted to be an English teacher when you were in college!’ Overall, it was the time when I unexpectedly and surprisingly met my friend! One of my friends asked for my mother’s phone number as he wanted to clarify about the reopening of his college. He joined the same institute where my mother is working currently. I just lent my mother’s phone number to him. A day before my departure, someone rang the bell at 6:30 pm and I just went down to open the door. When I opened the door, I was shocked to see my friends. It was a plan which they had made for me under a lot of chaos with my mother, ‘oh! How did you find my apartment? How did you know I was leaving today!?” ”I asked your mom’s number for this!” “You didn’t show up, that surely is a surprise for me!!” I never expected this from them, I was completely speechless. I remember a time that, I was surprised to meet my friends accidentally.  At the time I lived in Osaka. I went to Shinsaibashi, I have never been there before but there was an area called America mura and I figured I’m American. I'll check it out. I decided to eat at a restaurant there and was surprised when I was waiting to get into the restaurant. I saw my friend Kim walking into the restaurant, it was such a coincidence to see her at the restaurant too! And I talked with her for a little while when I saw her. Also on the same day when I was walking back to the station and on the way back I met another friend! I couldn’t believe that I saw two friends on the same day accidentally. I was pretty surprised and maybe it is a small world.

One time I was traveling to Walt Disney World. It’s about three hours away from where I used to live. We went to the main park, Magic Kingdom. When we walked in we saw that my friend who lived down the street was there on the exact same day and time. We were pretty surprised that we were all so far from home but at the same place. We decided to ride a ride or two together and then we separated as we were with our own families and decided to allow each other for family time. However that night we all got together and had a huge dinner together because we happened to all be there. I guess when there are only so many places that you can be sometimes you’ll run into people you know. One time I was out with my friends a bit late into the evening. We found ourselves getting on the final train for the evening. It was about midnight and realistically not that late. Back when I lived in America I recalled staying out until about two or three in the morning and enjoying the nightlife. However, I quickly learned that Japan was quite different. Since there is public transport more people find it easier to have that last drink before heading on the final train. You can really tell. As it seemed like all these people in black suits and ties were shuffling aboard the train. It was like being in a zombie movie where all the zombies were extremely well dressed. As the train went down the track you can see everyone shift and turn. You really have to think to yourself how could this many people get this drunk all at the same time?

I am from a very small town in Florida and not used to big cities and city life. One time I felt culture shock in my own country just from going to San Francisco. I was walking in the wharf which is a huge tourist area and you are surrounded by other tourists, performers, and homeless people mixed all together. People are performing around you. They are people trying to make money off the tourist population. But some people are just handing out things to show their support for political candidates or to hand out information. I was being handed things left and right and I was just taking them to make people happy. Until I took one guy's flier and he started to scream at me that what I took cost 5 dollars. I tried to give back his flier and he said he wouldn’t accept it for only five dollars. After arguing with him that I wasn’t going to give him five dollars, I just dropped the flier at his feet and walked away.

Well, yes. I have experienced a paranormal event. I was hanging out with my friends and as you do when you are young we were having drinks and were a little toasted. We lived with a roommate who was into the occult and the bizarre and happened to have an Ouija board, which if you believe in that sort of thing allows you to speak with the dead. We decided to turn on the CRT TV, which is the older TV in our house that still had a tube in it, to put on white noise. So we flipped it on to a channel with white snow. We pull out the Ouija board and start goofing off. Asking where we can get pizza, who is going to buy the next beer, etc. After about three minutes of this the CRT TV started going insane. It started to flicker and change like something was trying to communicate with us. We all decided to stop playing with the Ouija board at that moment. Now that I recall, we forgot to say goodbye on the Ouija board.

One time my friends and I dared each other to go to a place that we believed was haunted. Near my house there was a creek that we were told that bad things had happened there. So we decided to go at midnight to try and scare ourselves. It was difficult for us to even walk into that area as we were freaking out and terrified to go in. It was quite scary. Truth be told we weren’t able to go very far into the woods near the creek. My friends and I kept claiming that we heard and felt things. So we decided not to go any further. I was pretty scared honestly so I’m glad we didn’t go much further in the woods. I’m not quite too sure why we all thought that area was haunted. We just thought it was based on the stories that we were told at school. Of course they were all probably nonsense made up to scare other school children. But it was still a fun and memorable time. When I was in university, almost more than 10 years ago, the community security was not very good and we are often more than not in dangerous situations. One time, I was walking home from work, waiting at the bus stop for a bus. Then I heard the sound of gunfire from across the road. Police cars came around and the police shot at people across the street. I was so scared! The main reason was because you have no place to hide. You’re at a bus station and there's no place to go. There was another time when I was in Los Angeles driving and I took the wrong road and went on a small local road. And I’m not exaggerating here but both sides of the road were full of homeless people. Those people were moving around on the road and I was very nervous. They ignored the traffic rules and came right up to the car and made me stop my car. They shook the car and swore at me.  I thought to myself this is horrible because a few days ago someone was shot dead and maybe I’ll be next. One thing that scared me was once when I was out driving at night trying to get gas. Well maybe it was a little bit after 12 o’clock. I went to the gas station to fill up. I was finishing up and was checking out with my money, and then a woman suddenly jumped out from the side of my car, with blood on her face.  and I was like, “What’s going on here?” Then she said “I’ve been in a traffic accident! Can you give me some money? I want to go home.” and I only had $20 on me. So I gave her $20. I said “That’s all I have.” She said, “$20 dollars is not enough.” I told her that I couldn’t help her. I only have $20. She told me, “Well you can use your credit card, you can go over there and get the money.” Because we were at a gas station. She told me to go inside the gas station and use my credit card to get money. I told her “ Forget that, I can only help you here, $20 will do.” Then when I looked closely at her face I noticed she was quite young, like a University student. Maybe she came here on purpose to ask for money. One night I was out with my friends and we ended up going out to a bar. I’m not sure why we wanted to go to the bar but we ended up there nonetheless. There were some guys who were harassing these women and we decided to say something to them to try to get the women out of there. We walked up to these men and said “Hey, what are you guys doing?” with a tone of authority. The men stood up and the women took the chance to get out of there. One of the men was upset that the females left and was upset so he took a glass bottle and bashed my friend's face with it and ran out of the bar. I got tiny shards of glass in my face but my friend was really cut up. He has scars down the side of his face to this day from this event.
One night about 9pm I was heading home from work at about midnight and I was walking to my car. Suddenly two men came up to me and told me to empty my pockets. I was reaching for my wallet but I guess I did it too slowly for them because the next thing I knew I was being beaten by one of the men. I think I took a hit to my nose which made me fall to the ground and then while I was on the ground they decided to kick me in the face about three or four times. I was laying there bleeding and spitting out blood. They took my money and the worst thing is that even though this was a robbery my company charged me for a replacement id. So now I have less money. This was an awful experience. My Japanese isn’t very good but sometimes you’ve got to express yourself. I went out to eat with a friend and tried my best to order food. My friend convinced me that I said something wildly inappropriate to the waitress. At this point I had a few drinks in me and I was nervous. I really thought I said something that would really upset the person. What could I have said I thought! I was so nervous. But it turned out he was just playing a joke on me.  And I had ordered my food and didn’t say anything silly. I was extremely worried and pounded down a shot of sake just because I was a bit stressed out after that. I learned never to trust that friend again.
One time I was searching for my friend in Vietnam. They had gotten themselves lost and I was wandering around Ho Chi Minh city trying my hardest to find them. Their phone was off and it was me vs the city trying to find her. I had a picture of her on my phone so with broken Viennese I spoke to everyone I could see in order to try and find her. Most people just laughed in my face. I was worried that she was kidnapped or worse. My heart was beating faster than a dog’s heart. I was hot and sweaty trying to find my friend. I really thought all was lost and I would have to spend the rest of my trip at the police station waiting for her. Thankfully after hours of searching I finally found her near the hostel. All I wanted to do was sit down and relax after talking to everybody seemingly in this huge city in Vietnam. I think the first thing I go on when I go to amusement parks are the rollercoasters. I love going on them. But this wasn’t always the case! I used to be terrified of them. I think it’s because I used to watch a lot of shows on tv that showed accidents and crashes from amusement park rides. I remember I used to ask the people who worked there before I got on the rides, “Has there ever been any accidents on this roller coaster?” I know now that most theme park workers don’t care but their lack of an answer always scared me because what if I was the next person to get hurt on this ride? But they look like a lot of fun so I always went on. I guess that is the point of rollercoasters to do something daring that you would not normally do.
So I have no problems with roller coasters. I think they are fun. It’s those huge drop towers that you see in amusement parks that scare me to death. Normally they are so old and look like they haven’t been serviced in about a 100 years. There’s the long climb to the top and then that sudden drop. My heart races so fast and I can’t look when I’m up that high. I know that these things are designed to be safe but high places get me. Then that feeling of butterflies in your stomach as you're falling to the ground hoping that the brakes fire on when they are supposed to. Phew, those rides are the worst and scare me so bad. But somehow whenever I go to a theme park I always get dragged to them. Some people pelting stones at dogs and watching them yelp in pain amused, Some little children begging on the streets, people driving with mobiles glued to their ears, women standing in metros while the male passengers nicely remain stuck to their seats or mobile, talking loudly on the mobile often causing irritation to fellow passengers, all these make me disgust. Another example is in the hospital. There were almost 34 patients waiting before me. People of different ages are here. One thing that disgusted me here is that people are using mobile phones to watch YouTube videos and other videos in high volume. They have almost forgotten why they are here. They broke the peace around the hospital. Now mobile phones have become very close to everyone and some people can't live without using them. I appreciate the technology but we should obey some basic etiquettes. I think I dislike places that are crowded and people act like they’re crazy. It could be a club, a railway station,or a place where people are going insane. Situations like this make me feel uncomfortable especially when the place is too noisy or if I have been in an environment that is noisy for a long time. I don’t like the feeling of being pressed against people. Also I am not used to being in a situation where there is a lot of loud noises all the time. I remember I was at a private party that was very loud and it made me feel a little tired and sleepy. So if I feel a little bit uncomfortable, I usually drop my plans if I know the place will be crawling with thousands of people. Also, I don’t like places where the sunshine is too hot or the weather is extremely cold. Extreme cold and extreme heat will make me a bit uncomfortable. I don’t like to go to clubs. There’s so many young people there and most of them will drink a lot and I don’t really like to drink too much because I don’t like to be drunk. Also some clubs are very noisy and play music that I don’t really like too much, so I really don’t like to go to clubs. Also in my opinion sometimes when people are drunk. The music is too loud and the place isn’t really that safe. Everyone is really drunk and not really able to have a real conversation. I don’t know what kind of person would like to go to a bar for anything other than drinking a beer. But I can do that at my house.
One place I hate going to is major sporting events. There are so many people packed into a small space. The beer and booze is flowing like crazy and people get really drunk and get upset when their team doesn’t win the ball game. I don’t understand. Does everyone bet on these things? Is that why people get upset about losing? People destroy the city if they win or lose. We live beyond the year 2000. Shouldn’t we as a culture be beyond this? I hate how “man throws the ball well” is a career choice that gets millions of dollars. But hey if you need your kids to be educated thankfully they will be taught by someone who gets paid barely above minimum wage. But I digress, I don’t think I’ll ever go to a football game where the crowd goes insane. I just wouldn’t want to be there and have to pay a lot of money not to have a fun time
If I had to pick one place that I would never in a million years return to, it would be the place of business for my first job. For legal reasons I won’t describe much about it or the people that you could have found inside of the horrid place. However I will say that I imagine this place in my nightmares. It was poorly run and the management had the attitude of anything goes. So many things were broken at this place, people would be in many places that were critically unsafe, and staff and customers would regularly get hurt. This was all received with a shrug of the shoulders and the saying of “oh well what can you do?” There was a distinct feeling of negativity and lack of responsibility, the moment you walked into this building. Everyone was in on this, everyone just was there to collect a paycheck. Should we improve to help the situation? Should we rebel against management in order to make for a safer working environment? The answers to all these questions were always, NAH! Let’s keep going the way it is because change is difficult.  
Many people will pick the DMV as a place they never want to go to. Even in the movie “Zootopia”, it is shown to be staffed by sloths that are slowly moving attempting to do their job. But I’ve got a worse place for you that I don’t wish on my own worst enemy to visit. That is the immigration office. To be kind I’ll be vague about the country that this place is in but anyone who has had the displeasure of going to an immigration office knows this feeling. The one I have to go to is in a large industrial area far away from the rest of society. You have to line up with people that understand their day is shot to come here. The staff tries their best to be kind and helpful but the energy that you feel when you walk into this place is draining. The only way I can describe it is like a Kafka story, he was the guy who was famous for writing about the insanity of bureaucracy. Before you come here you need to have every single paper from multiple sources in order to keep on living. It can be quite upsetting to be in this place. But it’s somewhere you have to go! I can’t stand eating tendons. They are so disgusting. I feel like I’m a zombie in a horror movie. I’m always chewing, chewing, and chewing and it feels and looks gross. Just thinking about chewing on that rubbery meat makes me want to gag. I also hate papaya. If I smell papaya I instantly want to throw up. I think fruits and foods with really strong smells really make me sick and I don’t want to have these disgusting foods ever again. I’d much rather eat broccoli or chicken just please don’t ever give me tendon or papaya!
One food I never want to eat ever again is natto. Listen, this food is healthy. I know that. But it looks like snot, smells awful, leaves a terrible after taste and could be used in a horror movie as alien slime. I can’t tell you anyone who really enjoys this, that doesn’t live in Japan. Show this to any American and this would be the food they probably would pass on. When I get tricked into eating natto I think I want to gag. I never want to taste natto in my life. It’s so gross! Why can’t I just eat normal beans? I don’t need fermented beans. I'll just eat beans and vegetables instead.
